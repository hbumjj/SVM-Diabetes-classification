# SVM Project

## Overview

This project implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification for exercise and diabetes data analysis. It was developed as part of a course at Hanyang University.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

1. `svm-1.py`
2. `svm-2.py`
3. `visualization.py`

### svm-1.py

This file contains functions for:

- Loading data from text files
- Plotting train, test, and total data
- Implementing SVM with optimized parameters (gamma, C)
- Displaying scores using pandas

### svm-2.py

This file includes:

- Loading data from CSV files
- Feature extraction analysis
- Data preprocessing for SVM
- Utilizing functions from `svm-1.py` (SVM_support_vector_machine, Graph_Total_Train_Test)

### Statistical_Analysis.py

This file provides statistical analysis tools:

- Correlation heatmap
- Boxplot visualization
- Histogram and probability density function (PDF) plots

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
2. Execute the main script (not provided in the description)
